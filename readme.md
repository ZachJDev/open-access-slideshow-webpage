# Open Access Slideshow

A simple slideshow that pulls pictures and artworks from institutions with available CC0 and public domain collections.

## Using the Slideshow

Please note that initial searches may take awhile to return; the server spends a lot of time turned off, and it needs to spin back up. Subsequent searches will complete much more quickly.
